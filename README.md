# KiCad RP2040

I suggest cloning the symbol to your own personal lib. Makes it a bit more organized IMO.

Footprint and STEP file was taken from Raspberry's hardware design guide

I have a repo with extra info and KiCad files [here](https://github.com/Sleepdealr/RP2040-designguide), I recommend checking it out :D
